            <h1>Accessibility</h1> 
                <h2>Inclusive design</h2>
                    <p>We started out discussion on the layout wanting to keep it simple.
                       Keep it simple, keep it stupid. We have a simple menu that convey information in plain simple way. Since have not been asked to 
                       include elements like sidebars, or make an online store mockup. Our text is centered on the page like an article.
                    </p>
            <h2>Screen sizes</h2>
                <p>We have used CSS @media to control how our page behaves on different screen sizes.
                   Thanks to developer tools in browsers we can emulate an iphone 12 for example, to see how it would look on a small screen.
                </p>
                <picture>
                    <source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="images/iphone.png">
                    <img src="images/iphone.png" alt="emulated iphone user experience" id="iphone-img">
                </picture>
                <p>The margins are also adjusted for for different screen sizes. We did consider font size adjustment on smaller 
                    screens, but real life testing showed text to be ok. There is of course a concern for people who are visually impaired,
                    and perhaps a dynamic zoom would be the solution. But we have not been able to make that work properly
                </p>

            <h2>Reuse of code</h2>
                <p>Our navigation bar is reused for all pages. Page layout is the same for all pages except <em>FUN</em>, following 
                    the same flex-container and div-class setup.
                </p>
            <h2>Colors</h2>
                <p>After we settled on our nav-bar color, we used an online palette generator to find colors that would go well with the nav-bar.
                    You can see our selection here: <a href="https://coolors.co/04080f-507dbc-a1c6ea-bbd1ea-dae3e5">https://coolors.co</a>
                    We used the softest color in that palette for our background color, it is relaxing on the eyes and goes well with our black font. 
                    The contrast ratio for our background color and text sits at close to 20:1 
                </p>
            <h2>Code validation</h2>
                <p>We used online code review of html with <a href="https://achecker.achecks.ca/checker">achecker.achecks.ca</a> and CSS via <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validato">jigsaw.w3.org</a>
                    We did elect to ignore one problem, and that was replacing <strong>i</strong> with <strong>em</strong> in the navigation bar, as that would break 
                    elements of the navigation.
                </p>

                </picture>
                <p>Other interesting potential problems were alt text for our image of lagrangian points, the validator does not seem to like any description there.</p>
