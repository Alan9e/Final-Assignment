            <h2>Reflection task 1: Fake News</h2>

                <p>Our group has discussed together and arrived at the conclusion that we would define fake news as information that isn’t entirely objective, is perhaps exaggerated in order to provoke a certain response from the readers, or is just that – false. 
                </p>

                <p>Fake information or fake news, as we concluded together, isn’t published randomly, nor is it published by mistake or as a result of a misunderstanding. We believe that each time there is a reason behind people putting such information/news out there, a hidden agenda or something. We agreed that defining characteristics of fake news are that it’s often subjective and often meant to get a rise out of the recipients, mostly an emotional rise. Depending on what type of topic the fake news covers, we would like to go as far as to say that sometimes it’s meant to create an outrage from the public.</p>

                <p>As such, if we had to come up with our own definition for fake news, we would define it as follows – a piece of news or information, that isn’t entirely true but is loaded with a hidden agenda made to provoke a specific emotional response from the recipients.</p>

            <h2>Reflection task 3: Tackling the problem of misinformation</h2>

                <p>We had a discussion where we talked about what we can do to make sure that the information we receive, is reliable. And we all agreed that the best way to make sure, both in our personal and professional lives, is to think critically and put everything you come across up for a trial, so to speak. We believe that information that is factually correct, will always present its sources which then can be investigated further. Information that isn’t entirely correct factually, should have fewer sources or none at all.</p>

                <p>We can also suggest that in order to avoid being misinformed, we shouldn’t get all of our information from one place, but instead, use more than one platform or source. The best way to check the information, is to check multiple sources and compare and cross-examine. If it matches with the other sources, then it’s highly likely that the information is correct.</p>

                <p>Information that seems more subjective rather than objective, is more likely to be not entirely correct since, and we all agreed, facts are always objective. But here, we should be careful as well because information that seems mostly objective, is necessarily correct either, which is why we still need to check the sources and compare.</p>
