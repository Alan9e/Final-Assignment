            <h1>Learning to write code.</h1> 

            <h2>Work Experience</h2>

            <p>In my day to day work I mostly peddle in the Linux command line, php, python, or some obscure .NET release a customer might use.</p> 

            <p>Seeing how I work for a hosting company, there was is no way around HTML. Even these days with all the WordPress'es and Joomla's or Wix sites, there still are people who use static HTML for their sites. 
            If you've lived long enough, it is like Microsoft Frontend has returned from the dead.</p> 

            <h2>HTML</h2>

            <p>My understanding of HTML before starting this course was superficial, this is how you create a link, or this is how a <img src> works. 
            Even when working on our company <abbr title="Customer Managment System">CMS</abbr> pages, it is all bootstrap, javascript, json. Your task might be to change some text here, remove and element there. 
            All of this is almost never done by writing actual HTML. It is all hidden away in a template or php file.</p> 

            <picture>

                <img src="images/html.png" alt="cli code" id="clicode">
            </picture>

            <p>I find that really learning HTML is more about remembering a lot of rules, in the sense that there are good ways to go about it, 
            and there are horrible ways at going about. But it is not just about the semantics of writing HTML. 
            You also have to remember that what you write serves a purpose, therefor you consider things like colors, ease of reading, flow, making sure to not overwhelm, and making essential information easy to find. 
            It might sound silly, but I find it similar to painting, you make something pleasing to look at, but remembering that beneath the paint there is a structure.</p> 

            <h2>OOC, scripts, databases</h2>

            <p>On the other hand, coding in C, java, python, I seldom, if ever, think about the above. When writing some project at work, 
            it is almost always about figuring how can I get the information I need to solve the problem.</p> 

            <picture>
                <source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="images/cli_coding.png">
                <img src="images/cli_coding.png" alt="cli code" id="clicode">
            </picture>
            
            <p>Sometimes that problem upon being solved, also leads to something being written frontend. 
            Then the entire team has a view on how it should look.</p> 

            <p>The one thing about learning to code is that it never stops being a learning process. Technology is never at a standstill, 
            so you have to continue learning all the time. This is what makes coding amazing, because it never becomes the same process. 
            If you get tired of coding a certain field in IT, there is always something else you can look at getting into. 
            I think this is why I continue to work in this field, it is dynamic and always a challenge around the corner.</p>
